# H. Spark and Machine Learning [![home](https://github.com/choojun/choojun.github.io/assets/6356054/947da4b4-f259-4b82-8961-07ca48b2811a)](wsl)

1. Spark has two machine learning libraries with different APIs, but including implementations of similar algorithms. These machine learning algorithms and utilities have been designed to scale across a cluster by way of inclusion of parallel algorithms in which operations can be applied in parallel across nodes.

| Data Abstraction           	| Operates on the original Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). RDDs lack structural optimization schemas, making data transformations more manual and verbose. 	| Built on top of DataFrames and Datasets. This allows the library to leverage the Catalyst Optimizer and Tungsten execution engine, which dynamically optimize queries, manage memory efficiently, and result in significantly faster execution times.                                                                          	|
| Workflow Pipelines         	| Provides standalone algorithms. It leaves data cleaning, feature engineering, and cross-validation tracking entirely up to the user to write manually.          	| Introduces the concept of ML Pipelines (heavily inspired by Python's scikit-learn). It provides uniform abstractions like Transformers (for feature engineering), Estimators (for training algorithms), and Evaluators (for checking metrics). This allows you to construct and save clean, reproducible end-to-end workflows. 	|
| Cross-Language Consistency 	| Historically had separate, fragmented APIs across Scala, Java, and Python, with some features lacking parity.                                                   	| Historically had separate, fragmented APIs across Scala, Java, and Python, with some features lacking parity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  	|
