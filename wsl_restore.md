# D. Restore (Import) the Distro on WSL [![home](https://github.com/choojun/choojun.github.io/assets/6356054/947da4b4-f259-4b82-8961-07ca48b2811a)]()

1. In Power Shell, list the installed distro on WSL before removing the same / targeted instance. Note that you need to know the exact name for this process, especially those who wants to restore it at some point on the same PC or on those PC with the same name for distribution of distro. Note that the 'unregister' command will unregister the distribution from WSL and deletes the root filesystems.
~~~bash
wsl –l –v
wsl --unregister <targeted distribution>
~~~

2. Import the distribution of distro with Power Shell. Note that you may import the same distribution of distro into multiple install location, and this is good to facilitate your software development and testing purposes.
~~~bash
wsl --import <distribution> <*install location> <filename.tar>
    e.g. wsl --import Ubuntu-22.04-test1 c:/Users/choojun/Documents/wsl/Ubuntu-22.04-test1 c:/Users/choojun/Documents/wsl/my-backup-Ubuntu-22.04.tar
~~~

3. In Power Shell, verify the distro has been imported correctly.
~~~bash
wsl –l -v
~~~

4. The beauty of using both export and import commands is that you can quickly and easily setup the same environment on multiple machines or setup multiple distros in the same machine. Your users and passwords will be retained, including anything you have installed using the package manager.
